## Installation

Before you begin, ensure that you have [Poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) installed for dependency management. It is recommended that Poetry creates a local virtual environment in your project's folder.

1. **Configure Poetry to use in-project virtual environments:**

    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```

2. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Makkarik/crash-course-to-reinforce.git
    cd crash-course-to-reinforce
    poetry install
    ```
